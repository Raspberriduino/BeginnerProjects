The Dictionary is a very powerful data structure. The objective of this programming assignment is to demonstrate proficiency with dictionaries. You are to write a program that manages a dictionary of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's). Questions serve as the keys and answers serve as the values. Your program will use a menu driven interface to display the items in the dictionary, add FAQ's and optionally to delete FAQ's.
